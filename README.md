Explendid Tabs for Firefox
==========================

My userchrome.css file for Firefox allows to drastically change the look of it's tabs.

Firefox used to have themes. They were never great, but anyway, now we have personas. Which are
usually hideous, distracting, and don't really allow more than putting a photo in the background
while having a nasty white gradient on top of it. So, over the years, I learned about tweaking 
the userchrome file. A CSS file that overrides Firefox's default style.

### Instructions
1. Locate the chrome folder in your firefox profile. Create that folder if it doesn't exist!
   * Default in Windows should be 
`<User Folder>/AppData/Mozilla/Firefox/<Profile Name>/chrome/`
   * Default in Linux should be
`~/.mozilla/firefox/<Profile Name>/chrome`
2. Place userchrome.css in the chrome folder.
3. Restart Firefox
4. Ideally, apply this persona https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/subtle-gray/
